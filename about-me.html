    <p> Hi!</p>
    <p> I am Jinal Doshi. I am a Project Engineer at DCI Engineers, Seattle. My main interest lies in Performance based design and progressive collapse analysis. I like those subjects because it helps me to evaluate the structures in a much more sophisticated way and can have higher confidence in my design and eliminate any performance issues related to the building. I did my masters from University of Southern California, LA, USA (2014-2015) and Bachelors from National Institute of Technology, Surat, Gujarat, India (2009-2013).</p>
    <p>I like writing blogs about structural engineering because I like what I am doing and for myself, it is my hobby to understand structures. I like new challenges and take them head on. So you will see many posts from my side, may be one every couple of weeks. I mainly write about seismic design of structures as I like to deal with dynamics.</p>
