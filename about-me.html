      <h4> - Rajvi Doshi </h4>
      <p> Hi!</p>
      <p> I am Rajvi Doshi. I am currently enrolled in Front-End Web Development certification program offered by <b>UW Professional & Continuing Education</b>.
         <br>I have completed Bachelor of Business Administration in 2011 from Som-Lalit Institute of Business Administration, India.
         After graduation I worked for <br> over 4 years as an Administrative Assistant at <i>"QUADTECH, INC."</i>.
      </p>
      <p> I moved to Seattle, Washington on February 2017. After moving to Seattle, I had a thought of switching my career to a different field.
         My aim is to challenge <br> myself to the new field of expertise by learning & exploring something new with an advance technology. I always get inspired when I see someone coding or <br> writing a program. I am always passionate about learning something new.
         So, I decided to switch my career as a Front-end Web Developer. Apart from my career <br> I like hiking, gamming and biking.
