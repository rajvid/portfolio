        <h3><b>&#10158;</b> Introduction To Structural Madness :</h3>
        <p>Structural Madness, the name of the consulting firm that came across my mind. This is the name that I wish to have when I will be opening up my own structural engineering firm. I love designing   structures.I love to analyse them. My passion towards the subject is so strong that almost everyday I am surrounded by it.Structural engineering to me is not just an engineering involving mathematical equations, but for me it is an art.If you are a good artist then no one can stop you from being a good structural engineer.Structural Madness, the name of the consulting firm that came across my mind.

        <h3><b>&#10158;</b> Response Spectrum Analysis - II :</h3>
        <p>In the blog post about Response Spectrum Analysis I, I tried to describe response of the system, but one comment on the post rightly pointed out as the concept of spectrum was not described clearly, so in this post we will be talking about the concept spectrum and how it is generated, what it signifies and how is it helpful for engineers to understand the dynamic forces acting on the building.Now, if you have not read the previous part of response spectrum analysis, I would strongly recommend you to read it. In that part we discussed about what is response of a system under free vibrations and forced vibrations. In this post, I will be talking about spectrum and what to do with this spectrum.In the blog post about Response Spectrum Analysis I, I tried to describe response of the system, but one comment on the post rightly pointed out as the concept of spectrum was not described clearly, so in this post we will be talking about the concept spectrum and how it is generated, what it signifies and how is it helpful for engineers to understand the dynamic forces acting on the building.Now, if you have not read the previous part of response spectrum analysis, I would strongly recommend you to read it.

        <h3><b>&#10158;</b> Ductility In Structures :</h3>
        <p>Have you ever participated in a marathon? Or have you ever practiced for one? The only way you can finish a marathon is high stamina and a constant comfortable pace. If you run too fast, the energy in your body will drain out quickly and you will get tired within first 10% of the run. But if you maintain your own comfortable speed, where you heart beat is not too high then you could finish the marathon without even getting too tired. The key is glycogen stored in the body. On an average a person can store up to 2000 calories of energy that is readily available and then once this glycogen is consumed body starts burning fats to get energy which leads to fatigue. The key in marathon is to consume this glycogen efficiently and so you have to run at a comfortable pace. </p>
        <p>Similar to this concept, in structural engineering, a building has to perform under large forces without breaking itself to pieces. As we discussed about different sources of energy dissipation (which you can find here), we understood how inelastic energy dissipation plays an important role in resisting earthquakes. (The term earthquake resistant structures should be used in place of earthquake proof ).</p>
        <p>Inelasticity in materials generate large strains and large strains corresponds to larger deformations. Now how..</p>

        <h3><b>&#10158;</b> Madness - Tensegrity - Bridge construction :</h3>
        <p>I was bored after coming from work, I wished to refresh my mind so that I can do some work so I downloaded a game called Bridge construction from Google play. At first I though the game would be easy and it was easy in the beginning. But then I started realizing about what can I learn from the game. As within a limited budget I had to construct a bridge. Also using the limited type of material. So I really gave a thought. I started thinking about how can I construct a best possible bridge, should I use a truss or suspend it using a cable. I started making influence line diagram to find out the relative maximum force that can possible act in certain region of bridge. It was fun and a good learning experience.
        </p>
        <p>Let me share some of the thoughts that I gave on the application. </p>
        <p> In the structure above, I need to cover the total valley length of 60m and I was allowed to use concrete and wood with a support at 25m from one side. I just erected a concrete column at the assigned place and then simply made the truss. This was not challenging as well as I didn't have to give much of a thought.
