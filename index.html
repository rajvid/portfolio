      <h3><b>2.</b> 1914 translation by H. Rackham</h3>
<ul>
      <li>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and <br> I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of <br> the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. </li>
      <li>No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know <br> how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. </li>
      <li>Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but <br> because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. </li>
      <li>To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some <br> advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has <br> no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</li>

      <h3><b>3.</b> Introduction to Structural Madness</h3>
<ul>
      <li>Structural Madness, the name of the consulting firm that came across my mind. This is the name that I wish to <br> have when I will be opening up my own structural engineering firm. I love designing structures. </li>
      <li>I love to analyse them. My passion towards the subject is so strong that almost everyday I am surrounded by it.  </li>
      <li>Structural engineering to me is not just an engineering involving mathematical equations, but for me it is an art.</li>
      <li>If you are a good artist then no one can stop you from being a good structural engineer.</li>

      <h3><b>4.</b> Madness - Tensegrity - Bridge construction</h3>
<ul>
      <li>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and <br> I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of <br> the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. </li>
      <li>But then I started realizing about what can I learn from the game. As within a limited budget I had to construct <br> a bridge.  </li>
      <li>Also using the limited type of material. So I really gave a thought. I started thinking about how can I construct <br> a best possible bridge, should I use a truss or suspend it using a cable. </li>
      <li>I started making influence line diagram to find out the relative maximum force that can possible act in certain <br> region of bridge. It was fun and a good learning experience.</li>
